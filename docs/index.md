# Forge Windows images with every change reviewable.

WimForge brings offline image servicing, unattended setup, package selection,
Group Policy, WinForge-family staging, and recovery history into one focused
desktop studio. Your source stays untouched by default, your plan stays
inspectable, and project changes stay Git-backed.

### Review before elevation
See executable paths, argument tokens, dependencies, destructive flags, and
localized descriptions before any servicing plan runs.
</article>

<article class="wf-value-card" markdown>
### History without erasure
Every successful configuration change becomes a project commit. Selective undo
adds a compensating event instead of rewriting the past.

<article class="wf-value-card" markdown>
### Portable by design
Complete `.wimforge` saves carry project and notification repositories,
including the Git history needed for recovery and inspection.

## One workspace, one reviewable flow

<div class="wf-flow" markdown>
1. **Choose a source**<br>
   Inspect legally obtained ISO media, WIM, ESD, or split SWM sources.
2. **Shape the image**<br>
   Configure servicing, policies, unattended setup, packages, and typed bridge actions.
3. **Review the graph**<br>
   Validate paths, hashes, dependencies, checkpoints, and output destinations.
4. **Run and recover**<br>
   Execute with journaled progress, then export or save the complete project history.
</div>

!!! warning "Test the result before production"
    WimForge orchestrates Windows tools; it does not remove the need for
    licensing review, exact-image validation, backups, and a disposable virtual
    machine test. Read [Safety and Recovery](wiki/Safety-and-Recovery.md) before
    servicing a production image.

## Built for the work around the image
