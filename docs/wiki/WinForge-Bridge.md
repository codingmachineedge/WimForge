# WinForge Bridge

WinForge Bridge carries an approved declarative recipe—and optionally a complete self-contained WinForge runtime—into Windows installation media. The installed machine replays only the actions present in that recipe and saves resume state after each successful action.

The bridge is a strict contract boundary, not a guessed command-line wrapper.

## Studio workflow

1. Describe the desired post-install result or choose **Add typed action**.
2. Review proposals. Intent-generated entries remain drafts/disabled until approved.
3. Choose machine or user phase and enable only intended actions.
4. Select an optional published WinForge runtime folder with the folder picker and detect its contract.
5. Resolve every unsupported-capability warning.
6. Import/export the portable recipe with the matching open/save file picker when needed.
7. Choose the ISO workspace with its folder picker, then stage the recipe, optional runtime, and payloads.
8. Review the main project history and servicing plan; every recipe edit is a project mutation and is undoable.

The page uses non-modal Material surfaces. Invalid input becomes inline/snackbar/notification feedback while other work continues.

頁面嘅 runtime folder、recipe 匯入／匯出同 ISO staging workspace 都有相應 folder 或 open/save file picker，唔使手打完整路徑。所有提示都係非 modal Material 畫面；有輸入錯誤時，其他工作仍然可以繼續。

## Recipe actions

Recipes use schema `org.wimforge.winforge-recipe`, version 1. Every action has a unique stable ID, idempotency key, explicit `machine` or `user` phase, exactly one typed shape, and a SHA-256 digest over canonical typed fields.

| Kind | Typed data | Execution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `page` | WinForge page alias | Requires `launch.page.v1`; audited legacy mapping is `--page <alias>` |
| `module` | Stable module ID | Requires runtime capability `apply.module.v1` |
| `tweak` | Stable tweak ID and JSON value | Requires `apply.tweak.v1` |
| `command` | Executable, argument array, working directory, accepted exit codes | Direct process launch; no shell string |
| `registry` | Hive, key, name, type, typed JSON value | .NET registry API |
| `copy` | Relative payload, destination, SHA-256, overwrite policy | Hash verified before every copy |

Shell/script interpreters and `.cmd`, `.bat`, `.ps1`, `.vbs`, and similar command payloads are refused. Registry and file work must use typed actions rather than hiding behavior in an evaluated command line.

Unknown fields/versions, duplicate idempotency keys, tampered digests, path traversal, unsupported registry types, and mismatched payload hashes fail closed.

## Runtime capability audit

The adjacent WinForge source audited on 2026-07-10 was tag `v1.0.177`, commit `27f343be170c43675e4a97f3de152eafb6c99e20`. Its parser documents `--page <alias>` plus launch-oriented flags. It does not document headless module, tweak, or recipe application.

Therefore a runtime without a contract is classified as legacy with one relevant bridge capability:

```text
launch.page.v1 -> ["--page", "{target}"]
```

WimForge does not invoke imaginary switches such as `--apply-recipe` or `--apply-tweak`.

## Runtime contract

A future/published self-contained runtime can provide `winforge-contract.json`:

```json
{
  "format": "org.winforge.runtime-contract",
  "formatVersion": 1,
  "contractVersion": 1,
  "runtimeVersion": "1.1.0",
  "executable": "WinForge.exe",
  "capabilities": ["launch.page.v1"],
  "invocations": {
    "launch.page.v1": ["--page", "{target}"]
  }
}
```

The executable must be an ordinary file within the runtime directory. Invocation templates are argument arrays; placeholders occupy whole tokens. The staged contract records the runtime executable SHA-256 and the bootstrap verifies it before launch.

A legacy ordinary `WinForge.exe` is detected as version `unknown`, contract version 0, with only the observed page capability. A recipe requiring a minimum runtime version cannot use an unknown version.

## ISO staging layout

The verified bundle is placed under the conventional OEM-copy tree:

```text
sources/$OEM$/$1/ProgramData/WimForge/WinForgeBridge/<recipe-id>/
  manifest.json
  recipe.json
  runtime-contract.json
  bootstrap.ps1
  Payload/
  Runtime/

sources/$OEM$/$$/Setup/Scripts/
  WimForgeBridge.<recipe-id>.cmd
```

If no `SetupComplete.cmd` exists, the bridge creates one that calls the recipe fragment. If an ordinary text file already exists without the marker, WimForge atomically prepends a guarded call and preserves its prior bytes; an existing marker is already idempotently reachable. Unsupported oversized or NUL/UTF-16 files stop staging with an explicit error. Success therefore means the hook is reachable, never that a manual merge is still pending.

The manifest records format, recipe hash, runtime contract, installed location, bootstrap command, each file size/SHA-256, and total size. Source/payload/runtime trees reject symbolic links, junctions, and reparse points. Staging occurs in a sibling temporary directory and is promoted only after verification.

An unchanged bundle is idempotent. Replacing a different one requires explicit overwrite and uses a sibling backup during promotion.

## Bootstrap and resume

The generated Windows PowerShell parses data; it does not evaluate code:

- no `Invoke-Expression`, dynamic script block, or shell command string;
- process arguments remain separate tokens;
- manifest, recipe, payload, and runtime executable hashes are verified;
- state is atomically saved after every successful action;
- completed `idempotencyKey -> action digest` entries are skipped;
- changing a digest reruns only that logical action;
- failure records `lastError` and resumes at the first incomplete action later;
- machine actions run through SetupComplete;
- approved user actions use one HKLM RunOnce entry after interactive sign-in.

Page launches are non-blocking. Contracted module/tweak and direct-command actions wait for accepted exit codes such as `0` or `3010`.

## History and complete saves

Recipe JSON, runtime-selection settings, enabled state, and staging choices are stored as project configuration mutations. They receive action-history events and project Git commits, so `Ctrl+Z`, the active-page/global right-click mini history, selective undo, redo-of-undo, bookmarks, and `.wimforge` saves retain them.

The project save carries configuration and Git history. The ISO staging bundle carries the files needed on the installed machine. Those are related but distinct artifacts.

## CLI examples

```powershell
.\WimForgeCli.exe winforge detect C:\Tools\WinForge\publish --json
.\WimForgeCli.exe winforge template page packages --output page.winforge.json
.\WimForgeCli.exe winforge validate page.winforge.json `
  --runtime C:\Tools\WinForge\publish
.\WimForgeCli.exe winforge status page.winforge.json `
  --runtime C:\Tools\WinForge\publish --json

.\WimForgeCli.exe winforge import page.winforge.json `
  --project C:\Images\MyProject
.\WimForgeCli.exe winforge export `
  --project C:\Images\MyProject --output committed.winforge.json

.\WimForgeCli.exe winforge stage page.winforge.json `
  --iso D:\IsoWorkspace `
  --runtime C:\Tools\WinForge\publish `
  --payload C:\ApprovedPayloads `
  --include-runtime --overwrite
```

`validate`/`status`/`stage` can omit the recipe path when `--project` selects a project containing one. `stage` accepts `--include-runtime` or `--without-runtime`; an existing different bundle requires `--overwrite`. Project-backed staging commits the recipe/runtime choice and adds the staged OEM tree to the main servicing plan.

Implementation detail lives in [`docs/winforge-bridge.md`](https://github.com/codingmachineedge/WimForge/blob/main/docs/winforge-bridge.md).
